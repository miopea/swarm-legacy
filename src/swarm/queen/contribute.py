"""Reverse-sync for the interactive Queen's CLAUDE.md (task #258).

Companion to :mod:`swarm.queen.runtime`'s forward reconcile (task #254):
where ``reconcile_queen_claude_md`` pushes the shipped
``QUEEN_SYSTEM_PROMPT`` into the local workdir file, the functions here
go the other direction — taking local edits and producing a patch the
operator can land upstream in the swarm repository.

Design note (operator-clarified, 2026-04-22): **every diff between local
and shipped is a candidate for upstream contribution.**  The Queen is a
global role; there is no "deployment-specific Queen content."  Anything
the operator or Queen added locally should flow back to the shipped
``QUEEN_SYSTEM_PROMPT`` so fresh installs inherit the same improvements.
No per-hunk classification / local-only markers needed.  Operator can
defer a contribution by not running the CLI yet, or strip a hunk from
the emitted patch by hand, but there's no persistent "keep this local
forever" state.
