"""Canonical resolution of the Swarm (legacy) state directory.

Every runtime path — the SQLite database, the pty-holder socket, logs,
uploads, the Queen workdir — hangs off one directory.  Before the
relocation that directory was hardcoded as ``~/.swarm`` in ~50 places,
which is why moving it required a command rather than a config edit.

Resolution order, most explicit first:

1. ``$SWARM_STATE_DIR`` — an explicit override.  Used by tests and by
   operators running more than one hive on a box.
2. ``~/.swarm-legacy`` **if it exists** — the post-relocation home.  Its
   existence is the marker; there is no separate flag file to fall out of
   sync with reality.
3. ``~/.swarm`` **if it exists** — the pre-relocation home, still correct
   for every install that has not run ``swarm relocate``.
4. ``~/.swarm-legacy`` — nothing on this machine yet, so a fresh install
   starts where a relocated one ends up.

Rule 2 is checked before rule 3 on purpose.  After a relocation something
else may well create a fresh ``~/.swarm`` (that is the point of freeing
the name); preferring the relocated directory means Legacy keeps reading
its own state instead of silently adopting an empty stranger.

Rule 4 is why rule 3 is conditional.  The fallback used to be ``~/.swarm``
unconditionally, so a *brand-new* install re-occupied the name Legacy was
retired from — Swarm Next owns ``swarm`` now — and then greeted the
operator with the relocation banner asking them to undo what the install
had just done, terminating the workers it had only now started.  A machine
with no Legacy state has nothing to preserve and no reason to take the old
name, so it does not.  Nothing about an existing install changes: rule 3
still finds ``~/.swarm`` wherever it is already there.

Callers should treat the result as stable for the life of the process.
``swarm relocate`` moves the directory and then re-execs, so nothing has
to cope with the answer changing underneath it.
