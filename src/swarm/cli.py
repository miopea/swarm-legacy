    """Load config from swarm.db.  The DB is the source of truth.

    Architecture: swarm.db owns workers, groups, approval rules, tasks,
    history, secrets, etc.  YAML is a legacy seed format that feeds a
    **brand-new** DB on first run.  The daemon must never run against
    a YAML-sourced HiveConfig when the DB has data — doing so silently
    drops everything stored only in the DB (approval rules being the
    most painful example).

    Flow:
      1. If the caller passed an explicit ``--config path.yaml`` AND
         that file exists, treat it as an explicit override and load
         from YAML directly.  This is the "I know what I'm doing"
         escape hatch for ad-hoc YAML workflows and testing.
      2. Otherwise check whether ``~/.swarm/swarm.db`` exists on disk
         *before* we touch it.  If it does, it is the source of
         truth, full stop.  We open it and load from it.  Partially
         empty tables (e.g. no workers but rules) are NOT a trigger
         to re-migrate — the existing data stays exactly as it is.
      3. If the DB file does **not** exist, create it and run
         ``auto_migrate`` to seed from ``~/.config/swarm/config.yaml``
         and legacy files (tasks.json, etc.).
      4. Load the resulting config from the DB and return it.
      5. If after all of that the DB is still empty (truly fresh
         install, no YAML either), return a default HiveConfig so
         ``swarm-legacy init`` / first-run flows still work.
    """

    # approval-rule / group edits "disappeared" across restart even
