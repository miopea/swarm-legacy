"""The test suite must never write to the operator's production log (#1285).

FOUND 2026-08-06 while establishing, for #1275's AC-4, whether the running daemon
had reloaded onto current code. ``~/.swarm/swarm.log`` was the ONLY usable evidence
for that — the PID and start time are useless because Reload uses ``os.execv``,
which preserves both — and the log turned out to contain 3400 lines of test output:
``/tmp/pytest-of-*`` socket paths and ``unittest/mock.py`` tracebacks interleaved
with real daemon entries.

WHY THE EXISTING GUARD WAS NOT ENOUGH. ``conftest._isolate_logging`` already patched
``setup_logging`` in two namespaces and cleared the ``swarm`` logger — ONCE, at
session start. The leaked lines were INFO level, which a WARNING logger cannot emit,
so something re-configured logging MID-SESSION, after that one-time clear. Running
the tests that emitted them in isolation is completely clean, which is exactly why
this survived: it only appears when an earlier test in the same session re-attaches a
real file handler, so no single test file reproduces it.

THE FIX IS BEHAVIOURAL RATHER THAN A LIST OF KNOWN CALL SITES: a per-test autouse
fixture strips any handler pointing at the production log, before and after every
test, and names the test that attached one. It does not need to know who did it,
which is the property the old guard lacked.

MEASURED, and measured by ATTRIBUTION rather than file size: a full 5738-test run
added 0 lines matching ``pytest-of``/``unittest/mock.py``, down from 3400
accumulated. Size is the wrong instrument here — the live daemon appends to the same
file continuously, so the file grows during any test run whether or not the suite
wrote to it. An earlier size-based check showed +328 bytes that were entirely the
daemon's own term-trace.
