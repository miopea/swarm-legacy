A web-based control center for AI coding agents — [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), and [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex). Manage one agent or ten from a single browser tab — with autopilot, a task board, AI coordination, and email integration.

Every agent session runs in a managed PTY. The **web dashboard** gives you real-time visibility into all of them: read their output, type into their terminals, create and assign tasks, and let background **drones** handle routine approvals so your agents never stall. A **Queen** conductor watches the hive, proposes task assignments, detects when work is done, and drafts email replies — all surfaced as proposals you approve with one click.

## Why Swarm (legacy)

**Your agent sessions never stall.** **Drones** — Swarm's background poll workers — auto-approve safe prompts, revive crashed agents, and escalate the hard decisions to the **Queen** (a headless Claude conductor) or the operator. You stop babysitting and start reviewing results.

**You manage work, not windows.** Create tasks on a board. The Queen assigns them to the right worker based on project descriptions. When a worker finishes, the Queen detects it and proposes completion — you approve with one click.

**Your browser is the control room.** Interactive terminal attach lets you type directly into any worker's agent session from the dashboard. Drag an email onto the task board to create a bug ticket. When it's fixed, a draft reply lands in your Outlook.

**It works for one session too.** You don't need ten agents to benefit. Even a single agent session gets autopilot, a task queue, and a dashboard with terminal access.

## Features

**Web Dashboard** (primary interface)

- **Live terminal attach** -- type into any worker's agent session from the browser (PTY over WebSocket)
- **Task board** -- compact one-or-two-line task rows; click a row to open the full Edit modal with a WYSIWYG description editor (formatting toolbar, paste-from-Word/Outlook → Markdown, View-source toggle), priority/filtering, dependencies, and inline file attachments
- **Drag-and-drop import** -- drop `.eml`/`.msg` files (or an Outlook message tile, or a Jira issue URL / `KEY-N`) onto the task board to create a task with the source content imported and rendered as Markdown
- **Queen proposals** -- approve or reject AI recommendations with confidence scores, one click or in bulk
- **Config editor** -- tabbed UI: General, LLMs, Workers, Automation, Notifications, Integrations, Security, Usage, Advanced, Logs
- **Approval rules editor** -- visual regex rule builder for drone auto-approve/escalate decisions
- **Worker management** -- spawn ad-hoc workers, launch groups, kill/revive individuals, all at runtime
- **Outlook integration** -- connect via OAuth from the config page, fetch emails directly
- **Browser notifications** -- push alerts when workers need attention

**Autopilot**

- **Background drones** -- specialized watchers handle routine decisions so workers don't stall (see *Drones* below for the full roster)
- **Queen conductor** -- headless Claude that assigns tasks, detects completion, resolves conflicts
- **Proposal system** -- Queen actions require operator approval; nothing executes without your sign-off
- **Approval rules** -- regex patterns decide what drones auto-approve vs escalate to the Queen
- **Skill workflows** -- tasks dispatch as Claude Code skill commands (`/fix-and-ship`, `/feature`, `/verify`), backed by a SQLite registry with per-skill usage counts
- **Per-worker Swarm slash commands** -- every worker auto-installs `/swarm-status`, `/swarm-handoff`, `/swarm-finding`, `/swarm-warning`, `/swarm-blocker`, `/swarm-progress` into its `.claude/commands/` so the most-used coordination tools show up in `/help` and read cleanly in transcripts
- **Per-worker Swarm Skills** -- workers also auto-install the `/swarm-checkpoint` Skill (runs `/check`, then commits on green or reports a blocker on red) and the `/swarm-coordinate` Skill (advisory peer/task survey for delegation suggestions; never auto-creates tasks)
- **Pipelines** -- multi-step workflows with agent, automated, and human steps, dependency ordering, templates, and 5-field cron schedules (e.g. `"30 14 * * 1-5"` for weekday afternoons; legacy `HH:MM` still works)
- **Approval-rate gauge** -- dashboard header shows the drones' auto-approval percentage over the last 24h; `GET /api/drones/approval-rate` exposes the counters
- **Sandbox opt-in** -- enable Claude Code's native sandbox via `sandbox:` in `swarm.yaml`; Swarm detects CC version at install time and merges the overrides into `~/.claude/settings.json` when supported

**Drones**

Drones are specialized background sweepers that share the daemon's poll loop. Each runs at its own cadence and writes every action to the buzz log so the operator can audit and tune.

- **IdleWatcher** -- nudges RESTING/SLEEPING workers that have an assigned task; recovers post-reload sessions whose client-side MCP tools dropped by injecting `/mcp` and following up with the task description
- **InterWorkerMessageWatcher** -- nudges idle workers about unread inter-worker messages; widens the filter when the worker has no active task so informational findings/notes are not lost
- **PressureManager** -- system-wide memory/swap watcher that suspends and resumes workers under host-level pressure
- **ContextPressure drone** -- watches per-worker `context_pct`; injects `/compact` when the conversation fills (soft tier auto-compacts idle workers; hard tier interrupts BUZZING workers and defers WAITING ones)
- **Verifier drone** -- adversarial post-completion check that fires after every `swarm_complete_task`; tier 1 deterministic gates (empty diff / no `/check` evidence / open peer warning) short-circuit before any LLM call, tier 2 calls a dedicated verifier subprocess. Reopens the task with findings as a peer warning, or escalates to a Queen thread after the second consecutive failed retry. Operator override via `queen_force_complete_task` skips verification.
- **OversightHandler / TaskLifecycle / FileOwnership / StateTracker** -- supporting drones for Queen oversight, task transitions, file-claim coordination, and state classification

**Worker Coordination (MCP)**

- **MCP server** -- Swarm exposes an HTTP MCP server at `/mcp` so the agents themselves can coordinate via tool calls
- **24 coordination tools** -- `swarm_check_messages`, `swarm_send_message`, `swarm_task_status`, `swarm_claim_file`, `swarm_complete_task`, `swarm_create_task`, `swarm_park_task` (hand the current task back to the queue), `swarm_block_on_external` (mark a task blocked on an external dependency so the swarm stops nudging it), `swarm_get_learnings`, `swarm_get_playbooks` (recall reusable procedures synthesized from past successes), `swarm_report_progress`, `swarm_report_blocker` (declare task-dependency blocker, suppresses idle nudges), `swarm_query_peers` (read-only snapshot of peer worker state for handoff decisions), `swarm_note_to_queen` (lightweight side-channel note), `swarm_draft_email` (create a Microsoft Graph draft in the operator's Outlook Drafts folder — never sent automatically), the task-lifecycle set (`swarm_start_task`, `swarm_edit_task`, `swarm_unblock_task`, `swarm_archive_task`, `swarm_block_on_operator`, `swarm_relabel_blocker`, `swarm_annotate_resolution`, `swarm_request_jira_ticket`), and `swarm_batch` (run multiple ops in one round-trip)
- **Inter-worker messages** -- workers send findings, warnings, dependencies, and status updates to each other (or broadcast)
- **File claims** -- advisory locks prevent two workers from editing the same file at once
- **Learnings** -- resolutions from completed tasks are searchable by other workers for context
- **Compact telemetry** -- every `/compact` logs tokens before/after and the compression ratio so you can measure how effective compaction is per worker

**Service handlers (pipeline AUTOMATED steps)**

- `shell_command`, `webhook_notify`, `headless_claude` -- run shell commands, post webhooks, or invoke a headless Claude as a pipeline step
- `file_uploader`, `youtube_scraper` -- upload files to a sink, pull new videos from tracked YouTube channels
- `claude_code_security` -- run `claude code security scan --json`, deduplicate findings by `(rule_id, path, line)`, and return them for downstream steps to turn into tasks

**Also included**

- **Jira integration** -- two-way sync with Jira Cloud (OAuth 2.0), import/export tasks, create Jira issues from the task board
- **REST API** -- full JSON API with 250+ routes and OpenAPI docs at `/api/docs/ui` (open `http://localhost:9090/api/docs/ui` with the dashboard running)
- **SQLite persistence** -- tasks, proposals, messages, pipelines, skills, and history are stored in `swarm.db` inside the state directory — `~/.swarm`, or `~/.swarm-legacy` after [`swarm-legacy relocate`](#relocating-off-the-swarm-name--swarm-relocate); YAML is the seed/import format
- **Resource monitoring** -- memory/swap thresholds with optional auto-suspend of workers on system pressure
- **In-app feedback** -- a footer button opens a bug / feature / question form; submissions are filed as GitHub issues via the `gh` CLI, with a preview-and-edit step and automatic redaction of sensitive paths
- **Remote access** -- Cloudflare Tunnel support for reaching the dashboard from a phone or remote machine; optional named domain via `tunnel_domain`
- **Notifications** -- terminal bell, desktop, and browser push alerts
- **Tool-usage analytics** -- `swarm-legacy analyze-tools` summarises MCP calls, errors, and active workers from the buzz log so you can spot tool descriptions that need rewriting
- **Test harness reproducibility** -- `swarm-legacy test --pin-model=<id>` records an infra snapshot (model, provider, worker count, env fingerprint) in every test report so regressions are debuggable instead of mysterious

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+ (ships with the SQLite 3 stdlib Swarm uses for `swarm.db`)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) — optional; required only for the in-app feedback submitter
- **WSL users:** systemd must be enabled inside WSL for the auto-start service. `swarm-legacy init` detects when it's not and offers to configure `/etc/wsl.conf` for you (requires sudo).
- At least one AI coding agent CLI:
  - [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (`claude`) — production-ready, also powers the Queen conductor
  - [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) (`gemini`) — experimental
  - [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) (`codex`) — experimental

## Installation

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/miopea/swarm-legacy.git
```

This puts `swarm` on your PATH. No clone, no venv. Then run the setup wizard:

```bash
swarm-legacy init
```

This does four things:
1. **Installs Claude Code hooks** -- auto-approves safe tools (Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep) so workers don't stall on every file access
2. **Generates config** -- scans `~/projects` for git repos, lets you pick workers and define groups, writes to `~/.config/swarm/config.yaml`
3. **Installs background service** -- systemd user service (Linux/WSL) or launchd Launch Agent (macOS) that auto-starts the dashboard on boot and restarts on crash.
4. **Sets API password** -- optionally protects the web dashboard's config page from unauthorized changes

The dashboard is live at `http://localhost:9090` immediately after init. On WSL, a VBS auto-start script is placed in your Windows Startup folder so the full chain works unattended: **Windows boots → VBS wakes WSL → systemd starts → dashboard is ready.**

If a config already exists, `swarm-legacy init` offers three choices: **keep** the current config, **port** settings (carry over passwords, drone/queen tuning, notifications, etc. while refreshing workers from a new project scan), or start **fresh** (backs up the old config to `.yaml.bak`).

## Quick Start

The dashboard is already running after `swarm-legacy init`. Open it and launch your first workers:

1. Open `http://localhost:9090`
2. Click **Launch Brood** and select the workers or groups to start

Workers appear in real-time. Attach to any terminal, create tasks, and let drones handle the rest.

![Launch Brood — select workers and groups to launch](docs/screenshots/workers-launched.png)

The dashboard auto-starts on boot — just open the app each day. You can also launch workers from the CLI with `swarm-legacy start` (see [CLI Reference](#cli-reference)).

## Install as App (PWA)

Installing the PWA is the recommended way to use Swarm -- it gives you a native-app experience with its own window and title bar.

- **Chrome / Edge:** open `http://localhost:9090`, then click the install icon in the address bar (or menu → Apps → Install Swarm).
- **Safari (macOS / iOS):** Share → Add to Home Screen / Add to Dock (limited PWA support — some features may be missing).
- **Firefox:** desktop PWAs are not supported; use a bookmark instead.

**No offline mode:** Swarm is fully server-rendered and requires a live connection to the daemon. There is no service worker and no cached app shell — `/sw.js` is a kill switch that unregisters itself and clears any cache a previous version left behind. If the server restarts, the app auto-reconnects when it comes back.

**App badge:** the app icon shows a badge with the count of pending proposals (via the PWA Badge API).

**Share target:** the manifest declares a Web Share Target, so Swarm appears in the OS share sheet. Share a screenshot, a link, or selected text to it and the dashboard opens a New Task modal pre-filled with the shared title/text/URL, with any shared files already attached.

## Web Dashboard

The web dashboard is the primary interface. It auto-starts on boot via systemd (Linux/WSL) or launchd (macOS) and connects via WebSocket for real-time updates. Open the PWA or visit `http://localhost:9090` (port configurable via `port` in swarm.yaml).

**What you get:**

- **Worker sidebar** -- live state indicators (BUZZING/RESTING/WAITING/STUNG), one-click continue/kill/revive
- **Interactive terminal** -- click "Attach" to open any worker's agent session in an in-browser terminal (full xterm.js PTY). Type commands, approve plans, interact directly. The terminal uses xterm's WebGL renderer on Windows and Linux and the DOM renderer on macOS/iOS (falling back to the Canvas renderer if the WebGL context is lost).
- **Task board** -- filterable by status and priority; tasks render as compact rows (click to open the Edit modal); WYSIWYG description editor with formatting toolbar, live preview, and View-source toggle; drag `.eml`/`.msg` / Outlook tiles / Jira URLs to create tasks; Queen proposals banner with approve/reject/approve-all
- **Config page** -- tabbed editor with sections for General, LLMs, Workers, Automation (drones · Queen · workflows · pipelines), Notifications, Integrations (Microsoft Graph + Jira via OAuth), Security, Usage, Advanced, and Logs (live log viewer with severity filter and a running-daemon log-level dropdown)
- **Bottom-panel tabs** -- the work surface switches between Tasks, **Decisions** (Queen proposals + decision history), **Pipelines** (multi-step workflow runs), **Playbooks** (procedures synthesized from past successes), **Loops** (standing-loop controls), and **Harness** (improvement digest)
- **Queen tab** -- searchable archive of every Queen thread (operator chats, oversight findings, escalations, proposals); filter by status (active/resolved), kind, and worker, or search titles + message bodies; click a thread for a read-only transcript, and reopen a resolved one to follow up
- **Messages tab** -- the inter-worker message stream (findings, warnings, dependencies, status, notes): content search, unread-only and date filters, click a message for full detail, compose to a worker or broadcast, and bulk-delete; `*` broadcasts collapse to one row with per-recipient read state
- **Activity tab** -- the buzz log: a real-time feed of autopilot decisions and system events, with browser push alerts
- **Loops tab** -- operator controls for standing background-improvement loops: per-worker start/pause/stop, a global kill switch, and a live per-loop token-burn readout against the daily cap (loops are off until you start one)
- **Harness tab** -- the harness-improvement digest: the signals Swarm already mines (error-prone tools, suggested approval rules, playbook win-rates, dreamer-mined patterns) surfaced with one-click apply for the low-risk actions — operator-gated, never autonomous

### Login & passkeys

Setting `api_password` in the config (or the `SWARM_API_PASSWORD` env var) turns on the session gate for the **whole** dashboard, not just the config page: every route requires either a signed session cookie or an `Authorization: Bearer <api_password>` header. A handful of paths stay exempt so the app can boot and recover — `/login`, `/logout`, `/ready`, `/static/*`, the PWA manifest and icons, the passkey login endpoints, and the OAuth callbacks.

- **Login page** at `/login` — password sign-in sets the session cookie; sessions expire after 24 hours of inactivity. Repeated failures from one IP lock that IP out for 15 minutes after 5 attempts.
- **Passkeys (WebAuthn)** — register a passkey from the Config page and sign in with Touch ID / Windows Hello / a security key instead of typing the password. Manage or delete registered passkeys from the same page; the password can be changed there too.
- **`/mcp` is gated separately** — MCP HTTP endpoints use their own bearer token rather than the dashboard credential, so a worker or an external MCP client never has to hold the dashboard password. Genuine same-machine callers on loopback are trusted; tunnelled traffic is not.

If no password is configured, the gate is skipped entirely — local unprotected installs keep working as before.

| `Ctrl+[` / `Shift+Ctrl+Tab` / `Alt+[` | Previous worker |
| `Alt+B` | Toggle drones |
| `Alt+A` | Continue all idle workers |
| `Alt+K` | Kill worker |
| `Alt+R` | Revive worker |
| `Alt+N` | New task |
| `Alt+X` | Back to the dashboard home (`/`) |
| `Alt+H` | Kill the whole session |

| `Ctrl+F` / `Cmd+F` | Search the terminal (when a terminal is attached and focused) |
| `?` | Show the keyboard-shortcut help overlay |

## Task System

Tasks flow through a skill-based workflow pipeline. Each task type maps to a Claude Code slash command that handles the full pipeline — planning, execution, testing, and committing.

### Task Types and Workflows

| Type | Skill Command | Pipeline |
|------|---------------|----------|
| **Bug** | `/fix-and-ship` | Trace root cause → TDD fix → minimal patch → commit & push |
| **Feature** | `/feature` | Read patterns → implement → test → validate |
| **Verify** | `/verify` | Pull latest → run tests → verify behavior → report pass/fail |
| **Chore** | *(inline steps)* | Complete task → validate → commit |

If a task fails, mark it **failed** from the task row actions (or via `POST /api/tasks/{id}/fail`). Failed tasks can be reopened (`POST /api/tasks/{id}/reopen`) or reassigned without losing history — the full audit trail lives in `task_history`.

Skill commands are configurable via the `workflows:` section in swarm.yaml. Set a value to empty to disable skill invocation for that type and fall back to inline instructions.

### Task Lifecycle

1. **Create** -- from the dashboard, CLI (`swarm-legacy tasks create`), or by dragging an email onto the task board
2. **Assign** -- Queen proposes an assignment (or operator assigns manually) → worker receives skill invocation. Tasks with `depends_on` are blocked until all dependency tasks are completed.
3. **Execute** -- worker's agent session runs the skill pipeline
4. **Complete** -- Queen detects idle worker, proposes completion with resolution summary → operator approves
5. **Reply** *(optional)* -- if the task came from an email, a draft reply is created in Outlook

Tasks also support file attachments via the dashboard UI. Drag `.eml` or `.msg` files onto the task board to create tasks from emails — see [Email Integration](#email-integration) for setup and reply drafting.

## Pipelines

Pipelines are multi-step workflows that layer on top of the task board. Use them when a job is bigger than a single task — e.g. "triage → fix → verify → deploy" — and you want each step handled by a different actor.

**Step types:**
- **AGENT** -- dispatched to a worker (runs a skill command like `/fix-and-ship`)
- **AUTOMATED** -- runs a built-in action (e.g. pull latest, run tests)
- **HUMAN** -- blocks on operator approval before moving forward

Pipelines support per-step dependencies, templates for common shapes, and lifecycle controls (start / pause / resume). State is persisted in SQLite; the dashboard shows a live view of in-flight pipelines and their steps.

Manage pipelines from the dashboard or the REST API (`/api/pipelines`, see [REST API](#rest-api)).

## Queen & Proposals

Swarm runs **two Queen instances** by design:

- **Interactive Queen** — a full Claude Code PTY session, your conversational coordinator. Reached by clicking the Queen worker tile in the dashboard. Stateful, learning-aware, thread-aware. Handles operator-facing work: answering questions, framing trade-offs, directing workers via `queen_prompt_worker`, posting decision threads.
- **Headless Queen** — a stateless `claude -p` subprocess, the swarm's decision function for high-volume drone-driven calls: drone auto-assign, oversight of stuck workers, completion verification, escalation analysis. Parallel, shallow, cheap. Never touches the operator's conversation directly.

All Queen *actions* (from either) that affect workers or tasks go through the **proposal system** — the operator reviews and approves or rejects each one from the dashboard.

### What the Queens Do

- **Analyze workers** — when drones escalate a stuck worker, the headless Queen assesses the situation and recommends an action (continue, send message, restart, or wait)
- **Assign tasks** — headless Queen matches idle workers to pending tasks based on descriptions and project context
- **Detect completion** — headless Queen monitors assigned workers for completion signals (commits, test results, "done" messages); a high-confidence "not done" verdict backs off re-polling for 30 min instead of re-asking every 5
- **Draft email replies** — generates professional replies for email-sourced tasks when completed
- **Coordinate with the operator** — the interactive Queen converses, surfaces what matters, and uses Queen-tier MCP tools (`queen_prompt_worker`, `queen_reassign_task`, `queen_force_complete_task`, `queen_save_learning`, `queen_post_thread`) to act on operator directives

### Proposal Flow

```
Headless Queen analyzes hive state
  → creates proposal (assignment, escalation, or completion)
  → proposal appears in dashboard with confidence score
  → operator approves or rejects
  → approved actions execute automatically
```

### Interactive Queen CLAUDE.md

The interactive Queen reads her role from `queen/workdir/CLAUDE.md` inside the state directory (`~/.swarm`, or `~/.swarm-legacy` once relocated) — seeded on first daemon start from the `QUEEN_SYSTEM_PROMPT` constant in `swarm.queen.runtime`. **The operator can edit this file**; the Queen also edits it herself to document coordination policies learned through operator feedback.

On each daemon startup, Swarm reconciles the on-disk `CLAUDE.md` against the shipped constant using a three-state compare (what shipped last time vs what shipped now vs what's on disk):

- Shipped unchanged → no-op regardless of local edits.
- Shipped changed, no local edits → auto-update in place.
- Shipped changed AND local edits present → **drift-flagged**: Swarm writes `CLAUDE.md.shipped-latest` and `CLAUDE.md.shipped-last` alongside your live file, notifies the Queen's inbox, logs a buzz entry. Your live file is never auto-overwritten.

Reconcile from the CLI:

```
swarm-legacy queen sync-claude-md                     # three-way status (no writes)
swarm-legacy queen sync-claude-md --accept-shipped    # take the new ship; discard local edits
swarm-legacy queen sync-claude-md --keep-local        # acknowledge drift; preserve local
```

### Configuration

- **`queen.system_prompt`** — *headless-decision prompt* only. Prepended to the `claude -p` calls (auto-assign, oversight, completion eval, escalation). Leave empty on fresh install and the daemon seeds `HEADLESS_DECISION_PROMPT` automatically. The *interactive Queen's* role lives in `queen/workdir/CLAUDE.md` inside the state directory, not this field.
- **`queen.min_confidence`** — confidence threshold on a `0.0–1.0` scale (default `0.7`). Proposals at or above the threshold are eligible for auto-execution; below it they stay pending until the operator approves.
- **`queen.cooldown`** — minimum seconds between headless-Queen invocations (default `30`, rate limiting)
- **`queen.oversight`** — proactive monitoring of active workers: prolonged-BUZZING detection, task-drift checks, and an hourly oversight call budget
- **Auto-tuning** — Swarm records when an operator overrides a drone decision and surfaces `swarm.yaml` diff suggestions from the "Tuning Suggestions" card in the dashboard

Plans always require human approval regardless of confidence (confidence is forced to 0.0).

## MCP for Workers

Swarm runs an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server on the same port as the dashboard so the agents themselves can coordinate without going through the operator. Each worker is registered as an MCP client pointing at `http://localhost:9090/mcp`, and gets access to these tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `swarm_check_messages` | Read pending messages sent to this worker |
| `swarm_send_message` | Send a finding, warning, dependency, or status to another worker (or broadcast) |
| `swarm_task_status` | Query the task board (all / pending / assigned / mine); pass `{number: N}` to fetch the full detail of a single task — description, priority, type, tags, deps, jira key, acceptance criteria, context refs, attachments, resolution |
| `swarm_create_task` | Create a task, optionally targeted at another worker |
| `swarm_start_task` | Declare that you are now working one of your assigned tasks — this is what moves it to in-progress (the daemon no longer infers it from PTY activity) |
| `swarm_complete_task` | Mark the currently assigned task done with a resolution |
| `swarm_edit_task` | Correct the title or description of a task assigned to you, so the next reader sees the truth instead of a correction buried in a message thread |
| `swarm_archive_task` | Remove one of your own unstarted tasks from the board (filed by mistake, duplicate, throwaway probe). Archived, not destroyed — beats closing it with an invented resolution, since resolutions become learnings |
| `swarm_park_task` | Hand the current task back to `ASSIGNED` (an intentional set-down, not a blocker) |
| `swarm_report_progress` | Report phase / percent / narrative status — broadcasts over WebSocket to the dashboard |
| `swarm_report_blocker` | Declare a task blocked on another task; IdleWatcher skips nudges until the upstream task completes or a new message arrives |
| `swarm_block_on_operator` | Declare the task blocked on a **human decision** (merge authorization, spend approval, a credential only the operator can rotate) — no upstream task number needed |
| `swarm_relabel_blocker` | Change *why* one of your blocked tasks is blocked without unblocking it (the upstream shipped, but now a human must decide) |
| `swarm_unblock_task` | Clear the blocker on your own blocked task and take it back — returns to `ASSIGNED` and stays yours |
| `swarm_annotate_resolution` | Flag a closed task's resolution as stale or wrong so the next worker served it as a learning sees the caveat; adds a note, never rewrites the original |
| `swarm_request_jira_ticket` | Request that one of your Swarm tasks be raised as a Jira issue — files a proposal for operator approval, does not create the ticket |
| `swarm_query_peers` | Read-only snapshot of peer worker state (name, state, current task, context %, idle time, queue depth) to decide whether to hand off — never interrupts a peer |
| `swarm_note_to_queen` | Send a lightweight side-channel note to the Queen (auto-relays into her PTY; not a formal message) |
| `swarm_draft_email` | Create a draft email in the operator's Outlook Drafts folder via Microsoft Graph. Draft is never auto-sent — operator reviews + sends manually. Requires the Graph integration to be configured. |
| `swarm_claim_file` | Take an advisory lock on a file path (60s TTL) before editing shared code |
| `swarm_get_learnings` | Search resolutions and learnings from previously completed tasks |
| `swarm_get_playbooks` | Recall reusable procedures synthesized from previously-successful tasks (look before re-deriving a solved approach) |
| `swarm_batch` | Run multiple swarm_* ops in a single round-trip (sequential; nested batch rejected) |

The server speaks both Streamable HTTP (`POST /mcp`) and legacy SSE (`GET /mcp/sse` + `POST /mcp/message`) so any MCP-capable client works. Claude Code hook installation wires this up automatically during `swarm-legacy init`.

### Queen MCP tools

The interactive Queen has her own, elevated MCP tool surface — separate from the worker-facing tools above. She uses these to observe hive state and act on it on the operator's behalf:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `queen_view_worker_state` | State, task, PTY tail for any worker |
| `queen_view_task_board` | Open and recent tasks |
| `queen_view_messages` | Raw inter-worker message log (pass `full=true` when relaying verbatim) |
| `queen_view_message_stream` | Same log joined to recipient state; `actionable_only=true` narrows to idle + unread |
| `queen_view_buzz_log` | System activity feed |
| `queen_view_drone_actions` | What the drones are deciding |
| `queen_query_learnings` | Operator corrections from past decisions |

| `queen_edit_task` | Correct any non-terminal task's title, description, or acceptance criteria |
| `queen_unblock_task` | Clear a blocked task's blocker and hand it back to the **same** worker, still assigned (the owner-preserving exit from `BLOCKED`) |
| `queen_archive_task` | Remove any task from the board — not just an unstarted one — without completing it; archived, not destroyed (row and history are kept) |

## Email Integration

Swarm integrates with Microsoft Graph to create tasks from Outlook emails and draft replies on completion.

### Setup

1. Register an Azure AD app with `Mail.ReadWrite` and `offline_access` permissions
2. Add `http://localhost:9090/auth/graph/callback` as a redirect URI
3. Configure in swarm.yaml:

```yaml
integrations:
  graph:
    client_id: "your-azure-app-client-id"
    tenant_id: "your-tenant-id"        # or "common" for multi-tenant
```

4. Connect from the Config page in the web dashboard (OAuth PKCE flow — no client secret needed)

### How It Works

1. **Import** — drag `.eml`/`.msg` files onto the task board, drag a message tile straight from the Outlook desktop client (Swarm prefers the Graph fetch path so the full body and attachments come along, not just the subject), or fetch directly from Outlook via the dashboard. Each email becomes a task with the original message attached.
2. **Assign** — the Queen proposes the right worker; the operator approves (or assigns manually).
3. **Work** — the worker runs the task's skill pipeline.
4. **Reply drafted** — when the task is marked complete, the Queen writes a 3–4 sentence professional reply and saves it to your Outlook **Drafts** folder. It is **never** auto-sent.
5. **Review and send** — open Outlook, review the draft, and send manually.

HTML email bodies are converted to Markdown before storage (paragraphs, lists, headings, blockquotes, code, inline marks, embedded `cid:` images), so task descriptions read cleanly in the dashboard and pasted Outlook content survives a round-trip into the WYSIWYG task editor.

Tokens are stored in `swarm.db` (`secrets` table) inside the state directory and auto-refreshed on expiry.

## Jira Integration

Swarm integrates with Jira Cloud for two-way task sync — import Jira issues as Swarm tasks and push status updates back to Jira.

### Setup

Authentication uses Atlassian OAuth 2.0 (3LO):

1. Register an app at [developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/)
2. Add `http://localhost:9090/auth/jira/callback` as a callback URL
3. Enable scopes: `read:jira-work`, `write:jira-work`, `read:jira-user`, `offline_access` (`read:jira-user` is required to resolve your own account ID, which is how imports are routed)
4. Configure in swarm.yaml:

```yaml
integrations:
  jira:
    enabled: true
    client_id: "your-atlassian-app-id"
    client_secret: "$JIRA_CLIENT_SECRET"   # plain text or $ENV_VAR reference
    projects: [PROJ]                       # legacy single `project: PROJ` still migrates
```

5. Connect from the Config page in the web dashboard (OAuth flow — tokens auto-refresh)

### How It Works

- **Import**: routing is by **assignee**, not by label. The import query is `project IN (...) AND assignee = currentUser() AND statusCategory != Done`, narrowed to the issue types in `issue_types` (Story / Task / Bug / Sub-task by default — Epics are containers, not work). Deduplicates by Jira key. `import_label` and `import_filter` no longer exist; a config still carrying them is reported as a stale key.
- **Drag-and-drop import**: drop a Jira issue URL (or a bare `KEY-N`) onto the task panel and a single `POST /api/jira/import-by-key` call pulls the issue, comments, and attachments into a new task — no JQL config needed for one-off imports.
- **ADF → Markdown**: descriptions and comments authored in Atlassian Document Format are converted to Markdown on import (paragraphs, headings, lists, blockquotes, code blocks, inline marks, mentions, emojis, links), so the rendered task description matches what you see in Jira.
- **Export**: task status changes in Swarm auto-sync back to Jira via transitions and completion comments
- **Create**: push Swarm tasks to Jira as new issues with mapped type/priority (Bug→Bug, Feature→Story, Chore/Verify→Task)
- **Sync frequency**: configurable via `sync_interval_minutes` (default `5`). Swarm status changes are always pushed to Jira on the next sync; Swarm does not overwrite Jira-side edits on fields it doesn't manage.
- **Ticket badge**: a task synced from Jira shows its key (`KEY-N`) as a badge on its row in the task board — click it to open the issue. If Jira is connected but no site URL was recorded (tokens predating that field), the badge still renders, dashed and non-clickable, so provenance is visible rather than silently absent.
- **Acceptance criteria**: a linked task with no criteria gets them synthesized from the description it already mirrors — on assign, on Queen reassign, and on link (create-then-link assigns before the key exists, so linking is when the Jira context actually arrives). Gated on `drones.verifier_criteria_synthesis` (default on); the verifier default-passes a task with no criteria, which is what this closes.
- **Tokens**: stored in `swarm.db` (`secrets` table) inside the state directory, auto-refreshed on expiry

### Configuration

```yaml
integrations:
  jira:
    enabled: true
    client_id: "your-atlassian-app-id"
    client_secret: "$JIRA_CLIENT_SECRET"
    projects: [PROJ, OTHER]       # sync whole projects; legacy single `project:` still migrates
    issue_types: [Story, Task, Bug, Sub-task]
    sync_interval_minutes: 5
    read_only: false              # true = import/discover normally, refuse every write and log it
    # Status maps are PER PROJECT — workflows differ between projects, so a global
    # map transitions someone's ticket to a state nobody chose. An unmapped project
    # is refused rather than guessed.
    project_status_maps:
      PROJ:
        pending: "To Do"
        in_progress: "In Progress"
        completed: Done
        failed: "To Do"
    # Discovery proposes a map; nothing writes to real tickets until you confirm it.
    confirmed_projects: [PROJ]
```

## Remote Access

Swarm includes built-in Cloudflare Tunnel support for accessing the dashboard from a phone or remote machine — no port forwarding required. Toggle it from the dashboard toolbar (Tunnel ON/OFF). Configure a named domain with `tunnel_domain` in swarm.yaml.

## Updating

The dashboard checks for updates automatically on startup and shows a banner when a new version is available — click **Update & Restart** to install it. You can also check manually from the dashboard footer. Your config (`swarm.yaml`) is never touched by upgrades.

Claude Code hooks and the cross-task hook script (`<state>/hooks/cross-task-hook.sh`) are automatically reinstalled every time the daemon starts (`swarm-legacy serve`), so they stay in sync with the installed package version — no manual `swarm-legacy init` or `swarm-legacy install-hooks` needed after upgrades.

### Relocating off the `swarm` name — `swarm-legacy relocate`

> [!WARNING]
> **This is a destructive update. It takes the pty-holder sidecar offline, which
> terminates every running worker.** Stop or finish your workers first. Your
> tasks, database and history are *not* modified — only where they live.

Swarm (legacy) originally owned the `swarm` command, `swarm.service`, and `~/.swarm`.
`swarm-legacy relocate` hands those names back and moves this hive alongside them:

**A fresh install has nothing to relocate.** Since 2026.8.28 a machine with no
existing hive starts in `~/.swarm-legacy` directly, so the names below are never
taken in the first place. Relocation is only for an install that predates that.

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Command | `swarm` | `swarm-legacy` |
| Service | `swarm.service` | `swarm-legacy.service` |
| State | `~/.swarm` | `~/.swarm-legacy` |

Everywhere else in this README, **"the state directory"** means whichever of those
two you are on — `~/.swarm` on an install that predates the relocation,
`~/.swarm-legacy` after relocating and on every fresh install. It holds
`swarm.db`, the holder socket, logs, uploads and the Queen's workdir. Code should
never hardcode either: `swarm.paths.state_dir()` resolves it.

#### The upgrade, step by step

Two separate things. **Updating changes nothing about where anything lives** —
you keep `swarm`, `swarm.service` and `~/.swarm` until you choose to relocate.

```bash
# 1. Update. Nothing moves; both `swarm` and `swarm-legacy` are now installed.
#    (Or click Update & Restart in the dashboard.)
swarm-legacy --version          # expect 2026.8.28 or later

# 2. Look before you leap. Touches nothing.
swarm-legacy relocate --dry-run

# 3. Stop or finish your workers — the next step terminates them.

# 4. Relocate. Asks you to type 'relocate'.
swarm-legacy relocate

# 5. From here on the hive answers to `swarm-legacy`.
swarm-legacy status
systemctl --user status swarm-legacy
```

The service is re-enabled and started for you, so the hive is back up when the
command returns. Your tasks, database, history and config come across untouched
— only the directory holding them changes name.

If anything interrupts step 4, **re-run it**. Every step is idempotent and the
command tells you what is left; it is designed to converge rather than need
unpicking. Running it on an already-relocated install just prints
`Already relocated — nothing to do.`

There is no source checkout involved in a normal install: the service runs
`~/.local/bin/swarm-legacy serve` from your home directory.

Nothing about your hive's *contents* changes and you keep using Legacy exactly as
before — only under the new name. The relocation is what makes the old names
available for something else to occupy.

**Why the sidecar must go offline.** The pty-holder binds `<state>/holder.sock`,
and a Unix socket's path is fixed at `bind()`. Moving the directory under a live
holder leaves it serving a socket no client can reach, while the daemon keeps
writing to the old directory through an already-open handle. There is no way to
move a bound socket, so the workers go down with it.

Both `swarm` and `swarm-legacy` ship together, so an install that has **not**
relocated keeps working unchanged. `swarm-legacy relocate` is the only thing that
removes the old name, and every step is idempotent — if it is interrupted, run
it again rather than repairing by hand.

Already relocated? The command says so and exits without touching anything.

## Service Management

`swarm-legacy init` handles service setup automatically (systemd on Linux/WSL, launchd on macOS). These commands are for manual overrides:

```bash
swarm-legacy install-service              # install/start the service
swarm-legacy install-service --uninstall  # remove it
systemctl --user status swarm-legacy   # check status
journalctl --user -u swarm-legacy -f   # stream service logs
```

Uninstalling the service leaves your config and database untouched — `~/.config/swarm/` and `~/.swarm/` (including `swarm.db`) are preserved so you can reinstall without losing state.

**WSL prerequisite:** systemd must be enabled inside WSL. `swarm-legacy init` detects when it's not and offers to configure `/etc/wsl.conf` automatically (requires sudo). After enabling, restart WSL (`wsl --shutdown` from PowerShell) and re-run `swarm-legacy init`.

| `SWARM_SESSION_NAME` | Override the session name |
| `SWARM_WATCH_INTERVAL` | Override the poll interval (seconds) |
| `SWARM_DAEMON_URL` | Connect to a remote daemon URL |
| `SWARM_API_PASSWORD` | Set API password (alternative to config file) |
| `SWARM_DEV` | Switch installed binary to dev mode (`1` = auto-detect source, or path to source root). Re-invokes via `uv run`, skips update checks, serves web assets from source tree. |
| `SWARM_LOG_LEVEL` | Override log verbosity (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`) |
| `SWARM_LOG_FILE` | Log to file (path) |

Environment variables override the corresponding config file values.

## Configuration

All settings are managed from the web dashboard at `/config` — a tabbed editor with sections for General, LLMs, Workers, Automation (drones · Queen · workflows · pipelines), Notifications, Integrations, Security, Usage, Advanced, and Logs. Changes save directly to the hive database and are hot-applied in the same request — no daemon restart required.

![Config editor — workers, drones, Queen tuning](docs/screenshots/config-editor.png)

**Runtime state lives in SQLite — `swarm.db` in the state directory is the source of truth.** On first run Swarm seeds the DB from a YAML (renaming the source file to `config.yaml.migrated` once consumed); from then on the daemon reads and writes workers, groups, approval rules, tasks, proposals, task history, messages, pipelines, buzz log, secrets, and scalar config directly from the DB. Dashboard edits hit the DB immediately and are hot-applied in the same request; **YAML is not re-written** by the dashboard. Use `swarm-legacy db stats`, `swarm-legacy db export`, `swarm-legacy db backup`, `swarm-legacy db restore`, and `swarm-legacy db prune` to inspect and maintain it (the daemon also auto-backs-up daily and runs an integrity check).

**YAML is a bootstrap-only seed.** `swarm-legacy init` writes the initial config to `~/.config/swarm/config.yaml` and you can also place a `swarm.yaml` in your project directory. The YAML loaders are consulted **only when `swarm.db` has no user data** (fresh install, explicit DB-empty bootstrap). For a populated DB the YAML loaders — including the `-c /path/to/config.yaml` flag — are intentionally ignored, with a WARNING log on every silently-discarded `-c`. Re-importing from YAML after first run is possible but explicit; treat `swarm.yaml` as a seed/import format, not a live mirror.

### Notable Fields

- **`provider`** -- global AI provider (`claude`, `gemini`, `codex`). Claude is production-ready; Gemini and Codex are experimental stubs. Per-worker `provider` overrides the global default.
- **`workers[].description`** -- helps the Queen match tasks to workers; shown in dashboards
- **`default_group`** -- auto-launched when you run `swarm-legacy start` with no target
- **`drones.approval_rules`** -- regex pattern → action (`approve` or `escalate`) for choice menus
- **`queen.system_prompt`** -- *headless-decision prompt only* (auto-assign, oversight, completion eval, escalation). Leave empty to auto-seed `HEADLESS_DECISION_PROMPT` on daemon start. The interactive Queen's role lives in `~/.swarm/queen/workdir/CLAUDE.md`, edited in place (see `swarm-legacy queen sync-claude-md` for update-drift reconciliation).
- **`workflows`** -- override skill commands per task type; set to empty to disable
- **`drones.poll_interval_buzzing/waiting/resting`** -- per-state poll interval overrides (set to `0` to use defaults derived from `poll_interval`: buzzing=2×, waiting=1×, resting=3×)
- **`drones.allowed_read_paths`** -- paths where Read() tool auto-approves without escalation
- **`drones.auto_complete_min_idle`** -- seconds a worker must be idle before Queen proposes task completion
- **`drones.idle_nudge_max_repeats`** -- consecutive no-progress idle-nudges before the watcher escalates to the operator instead of re-poking (`0` = unbounded)
- **`drones.native_goal_enabled` / `native_goal_max_turns`** -- seed a task's `acceptance_criteria` as a native `/goal` on providers that support it (Claude Code); `max_turns` is the runaway bound baked into the condition
- **`drones.dreamer_interval_seconds` / `dreamer_lookback_hours` / `dreamer_min_pattern_count`** -- the pattern-mining "dreamer" drone: how often it sweeps the buzz log, the window it mines, and how many repeats before a pattern becomes a learning
- **`drones.native_loop_coexistence_enabled` / `native_loop_grace_seconds`** -- native `/loop` support: leave a worker parked between loop fires undisturbed (no idle-nudge / assign-over); `grace_seconds` pads the ScheduleWakeup dwell read from the worker
- **`drones.task_token_ceiling`** -- per-task OUTPUT-token budget ceiling (`0` = off); on breach the task is escalated and parked (`ACTIVE → BLOCKED`) without interrupting the PTY
- **`drones.standing_loop_daily_token_cap` / `standing_loop_topics`** -- standing background-improvement loops: rolling 24h per-loop output-token cap (the loop sleeps when exhausted), and an optional override of the built-in deterministic topic set
- **`action_buttons`** -- customize the dashboard action bar (built-in actions or custom commands)
- **`task_buttons`** -- customize the task row action buttons
- **`tunnel_domain`** -- custom domain for a named Cloudflare tunnel (leave empty for random subdomain)
- **`integrations.graph`** -- Azure AD app credentials for Outlook email integration
- **`integrations.jira`** -- Jira Cloud credentials and sync settings (OAuth 2.0)
- **`queen.oversight`** -- automated monitoring of worker progress (buzzing threshold, drift checks, rate limits)
- **`coordination`** -- multi-worker coordination mode (`single-branch` or `worktree`) and file ownership tracking (`off`, `warning`, `hard-block`)
- **`workers[].isolation`** -- `"worktree"` to run the worker in a git worktree for file isolation
- **`custom_llms`** -- define custom AI CLI tools beyond the built-in claude/gemini/codex providers
- **`provider_overrides`** -- customize state detection patterns, approval keys, and env settings per provider
- **`drones.state_thresholds`** -- tunable hysteresis for state detection (buzzing confirm count, stung confirm count, revive grace period)
- **`drones.sleeping_threshold`** -- seconds of idle before a RESTING worker is shown as SLEEPING (reduced poll rate). Also governs when INV-2 demotes that worker's ACTIVE task (#1538), so lowering it shortens how long a pause may last before the task returns to ASSIGNED
- **`drones.stung_reap_timeout`** -- seconds before a STUNG worker is auto-removed
- **`drones.context_warning_threshold` / `context_critical_threshold`** -- fractions of Claude's context window that trigger warning / critical alerts
- **`trust_proxy`** -- honor `X-Forwarded-For` when running behind a reverse proxy
- **`domain`** -- public domain used as the WebAuthn Relying Party ID for passkey auth
- **`resources`** -- memory / swap thresholds; at HIGH workers auto-suspend, at CRITICAL the operator is paged. Also enables D-state process scanning.

## REST API

The daemon exposes a JSON API on the same port as the web dashboard. All mutating `/api/` endpoints require an `X-Requested-With` header (CSRF protection).

**Auth:** when `api_password` is set, *every* route requires a session cookie or `Authorization: Bearer <api_password>` — see [Login & passkeys](#login--passkeys) for the exempt paths and the separate `/mcp` token.

### Security

- All mutating `/api/` endpoints require an `X-Requested-With` header (CSRF protection)
- Rate limited at 60 requests/minute per client IP
- `api_password` gates the entire dashboard behind a session cookie or Bearer token, with a login page, WebAuthn passkey sign-in, a 24-hour idle timeout, and per-IP lockout after 5 failed attempts
- `/mcp`, `/mcp/sse`, and `/mcp/message` use a dedicated MCP bearer token instead of the dashboard credential, since they can trigger code execution in worker PTYs

```

**Worker states:**
- **BUZZING** -- actively working (Claude is processing)
- **RESTING** -- idle, waiting for input
- **SLEEPING** -- idle beyond `drones.sleeping_threshold` (default 900 s / 15 min); drones use `sleeping_poll_interval` (default `30s`) for reduced polling frequency. A `Worker` built without a config falls back to the in-code `SLEEPING_THRESHOLD = 1200.0` — that fallback only applies to fixtures and tests, since the daemon passes the configured value at construction (#1415). **Not display-only:** since #1538, INV-2 demotes a paused worker's ACTIVE task once it reads SLEEPING, so this threshold also decides how long a pause may last before the task returns to ASSIGNED.
- **WAITING** -- blocked on a prompt (plan approval, choice menu, user question)
- **STUNG** -- exited or crashed

The PTY-over-WebSocket terminal bridge supports up to 20 concurrent sessions.

**Decision layers:**
1. **Hooks** -- per-worker Claude Code hooks for instant tool approvals
2. **Drones** -- background polling that auto-approves, revives, and escalates
3. **Queen** -- headless Claude for cross-worker coordination, task assignment, and email replies

## Testing

`swarm-legacy test` runs a supervised end-to-end orchestration test against a dedicated instance (port `9091` by default).

1. **Scaffolds a synthetic project** -- copies a fixture project to a temp directory and initializes a git repo with pre-loaded tasks from `tasks.yaml`
2. **Auto-resolves proposals** -- a TestOperator subscribes to new proposals, waits `auto_resolve_delay` seconds (default `4.0`), then asks the Queen to evaluate and approve or reject each one
3. **Generates an AI-powered report** -- computes aggregated stats (decision distribution, rule hits, state changes, latency, Queen confidence), runs a headless LLM for actionable suggestions (rule changes, threshold adjustments, uncovered patterns), and writes a markdown report with cross-run trend comparisons

Reports are saved as JSONL logs at `~/.swarm/reports/`. Configure via the `test:` section in swarm.yaml.

## Development

git clone https://github.com/miopea/swarm-legacy.git
cd swarm-legacy
uv sync                    # install dependencies
uv run swarm-legacy --help  # run CLI from source
uv run pytest tests/ -q    # run test suite
uv run ruff check src/     # linting

```

### Releases

Swarm (legacy) uses calver (`YYYY.M.D[.N]`). The release helper at `scripts/release.py` bumps the version anchor across `pyproject.toml` and `src/swarm/__init__.py` and promotes `CHANGELOG.md`'s `## Unreleased` section to a dated entry in a single motion. The global `/ship` slash command auto-detects this script and runs it before committing — no manual invocation required for normal flows. See `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (Release Management) for the contract every release script must honour.
